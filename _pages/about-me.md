### Interactive Corner

If you have at least one of them (sunshine, laughter, or love), **give me a five** by clicking the button below:
<button id="highFiveButton" style="padding: 10px; background-color: #ffcc00; color: #000; font-size: 16px; border: none; border-radius: 5px; cursor: pointer;"> High Five!</button>  
<p id="highFiveCount">High Fives Given: 0</p >  

<script>
  let highFiveCount = 0;
  document.getElementById("highFiveButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    highFiveCount++;
    document.getElementById("highFiveCount").innerText = `High Fives Given: ${highFiveCount}`;
  });
</script>
