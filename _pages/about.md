    <p>I am Xiulian Ouyang, a research assistant at CEIBS.My career goal is to conduct research and teach leadership,
        well-being, identity, and status, aiming to grow as a great scholar at a leading research university. In this
        role, I aspire to advance theoretical frameworks, mentor emerging researchers passionate about academia, and
        contribute to resolving complex real-world challenges. To achieve this career goal, I seek to attend a
        distinguished PhD program where I can deepen my understanding of the existing literature, sharpen my research
        acumen through ongoing dialogues with professors, peers, and professionals across diverse organizational
        contexts, gain valuable experience by proactively contributing to the research of others, enhance academic
        abilities by working closely with and learning from leading scholars in the field, and develop valuable networks
        of information and shared scholarly passion.</p>
    <div id="more-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>In terms of leadership, I am particularly interested in positive leadership styles, such as servant
            leadership, authentic leadership, and ethical leadership. To fill existing gaps in the current research, I
            first aim to examine the similarities and distinctions among these positive leading behaviors. By reviewing
            and synthesizing the current literature, I hope to further clarify their characteristics. Building on this,
            I plan to use experimental designs and field interventions to explore why and how leaders’ factors (e.g.,
            personal traits, values, and past experiences) and contextual factors (e.g., organizational climate,
            leaders’ affective states, and energy level) drive leaders to adopt different behaviors. Additionally, since
            leaders often display multiple leadership behaviors in real-world management, I seek to understand the
            prevalence profiles of different leadership styles, their key antecedents across diverse organizations and
            groups, and how letious combinations of these styles impact employees' attitudes, behaviors, and
            performance.
        </p>
        <p>I am also deeply interested in employee well-being, driven by my belief that people are the ultimate purpose.
            I genuinely care about working individuals' physical and psychological health, particularly how work-related
            stress and work/nonwork recovery practices influence employees' short- and long-term well-being. Recently, I
            have observed the growing popularity of activities like cycling and hiking in Shanghai, a fast-paced,
            high-demand city. Fully geared up and eagerly heading for hiking trips immediately after finishing work on
            Friday has become a trendy phenomenon on social media. As an avid participant, I once spent two days and one
            night hiking and noticed those desolate mountains were crowded with young people, even as late as 1-2 AM.
            This sparked my curiosity about the essence and impact of this activity. What drives these busy young people
            to spend so much time traveling to remote places for such pursuits? Whether and how do their stress levels,
            emotions, and energy fluctuate before, during, and after this activity? What are the positive and negative
            effects of this activity on them in the short and long term? Whether and how these effects spill over to the
            work domain? Since the current focus on recovery tends to emphasize psychological experiences—psychological
            detachment, relaxation, mastery, and control—with far less attention paid to the activities themselves, I
            seek to further define and distinguish the essence of after-work activities and identify other mechanisms
            beyond current psychological experiences that foster the process of being recovered.</p>
        <p>Another key area of interest for me includes identity and status—particularly how multiple identities and
            diverse statuses are formed, evolve, and influence individuals within and across groups. I am particularly
            intrigued by groups with complex and often conflicting experiences, such as individuals from remote,
            impoverished areas who ascend to high-status professions or those from affluent, highly educated backgrounds
            who find themselves in low autonomy or menial roles. I am interested in conducting a longitudinal study on
            these groups to trace the developmental trajectories of their identities and statuses, uncovering the
            antecedents, mechanisms, outcomes, and moderating factors that shape these processes, making a substantial
            contribution to theory and practice. I have initiated discussions with the leader and team at GEDAR
            Highrise. This non-profit organization supports academically talented students from remote, disadvantaged
            regions through scholarships and career development programs. They have expressed strong interest in
            collaborating on this project, offering a promising opportunity to advance this research initiative.
