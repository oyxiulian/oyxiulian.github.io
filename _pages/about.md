    <p>I am Xiulian Ouyang, a research assistant at CEIBS. My career goal is to conduct research and teach leadership,
        well-being, identity, and status, aiming to grow as a great scholar at a leading research university. In this
        role, I aspire to advance theoretical frameworks, mentor emerging researchers passionate about academia, and
        contribute to resolving complex real-world challenges. To achieve this career goal, I seek to attend a
        distinguished PhD program where I can deepen my understanding of the existing literature, sharpen my research
        acumen through ongoing dialogues with professors, peers, and professionals across diverse organizational
        contexts, gain valuable experience by proactively contributing to the research of others, enhance academic
        abilities by working closely with and learning from leading scholars in the field, and develop valuable networks
        of information and shared scholarly passion.</p>
    <div id="more-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>My research interests in leadership, employee well-being, and identity and status stem from years of personal
            observation, social activities, and diverse work experiences. From a young age, my innate extroversion
            allowed me to connect with many people, sparking my interest in understanding people. This curiosity drove
            me to actively observe and engage with others, inspiring me to initiate social research projects since high
            school (e.g., studying blue- collar workers' living and working conditions). As I reflected on my
            observations and gained more working experiences (e.g., roles as a teacher, consulting assistant, and
            research assistant at Ipsos), this passion evolved into a conscious effort to explore what I could further
            do for myself and the people around me. Over time, I realized that my true passion extends beyond earning a
            living, seeking promotions, or helping others; it lies in understanding the broader dynamics of the
            workplace and contributing to developing a friendly and effective working environment.
        </p>
        <p>I have been blessed with several impactful academic experiences that have shaped my career goals and prepared
            me for them. Three key experiences stand out: my graduate study at the Advanced Institute of Business at
            Tongji University, the first project I led, and my one- and-a-half years as a full-time research assistant
            for Prof. Kim Tae-Yeol. At the Advanced Institute of Business, I had the opportunity to meet with many
            professors from top business schools, which gave me a clearer understanding of the research path and
            strengthened my resolve to develop the skills to conduct high-quality research. Additionally, the rigorous
            doctoral courses, seminars, and workshops covering various topics, methodologies, and software tools further
            fueled my passion for high-quality research and deepened my understanding of the field. Moreover, reviewing
            literature and drafting three manuscripts across various topics and theories gave me a solid foundation for
            future research endeavors.</p>
        <p>My experience conducting my first independent project, <em>Visualizing Supervisor Support Research: A Review of
            Literature and Directions for Future Research</em>, is also pivotal. Over several months, I immersed myself in
            literature, learned bibliometric software, analyzed data, and drafted the manuscript. This continuous
            learning, ideation, and revision process resulted in significant improvements to my paper, reinforcing my
            ability to think independently and persevere through challenges. I am also grateful for the reviewers’
            detailed and constructive feedback, which highlighted areas for improvement and guided me to elevate my work
            to a higher standard. This experience deepened my understanding of the research process, enhanced my
            professionalism and perseverance, and boosted my confidence in pursuing a PhD.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most critical research experience is my one-and-a-half-year role as a full-time research assistant for
            Prof. Kim Tae-Yeol at China Europe International Business School (CEIBS). Thanks to Prof. Kim’s great
            guidance and mentorship, I have participated in many research projects (please refer to my CV for details)
            and learned to work as a scholar. Through projects, I have been proficient in conducting literature reviews,
            developing models and scales, and analyzing data using advanced techniques. For example, I conducted
            multilevel polynomial regression analyses to test the effect of growth mindset with Mplus, Stata, and R.
            Moreover, I realized that to become a great scholar, I must continuously push my boundaries and develop
            efficient work systems, as demonstrated by Prof. Kim. Influenced by his example, I took the initiative to
            automate time-consuming tasks like formatting tables in Excel by developing VBA code. I also improved the R
            code for calculating correlations, running Monte Carlo simulations, and reporting results directly in Excel.
            Through his mentorship, I have also learned to prioritize tasks, work proactively, and collaborate
            effectively. For instance, when managing multiple projects, I tried to provide quick feedback during the
            exploration phase while maintaining professionalism in finalizing results. I planned early to keep projects
            on track and worked closely with team members. I am deeply grateful for these invaluable experiences, which
            have shaped my efficiency and guided me toward my career goals.
        </p>

            For my research interests, one key area of focus is leadership, particularly positive leadership styles,
            such as servant leadership, empowering leadership, authentic leadership, and ethical leadership. To fill
            existing gaps in the current research, I first aim to examine the similarities and distinctions among these
            positive leading behaviors. By reviewing and synthesizing the current literature, I hope to further clarify
            their characteristics. Building on this, I plan to use experimental designs and field interventions to
            explore why and how leaders’ personal factors (e.g., personal traits, values, and past experiences) and
            contextual factors (e.g., organizational climate, leaders’ affective states, and energy level) drive leaders
            to adopt different behaviors. Additionally, since leaders often display multiple leadership behaviors in
            real-world management, I seek to understand the prevalence profiles of different leadership styles, their
            key antecedents across diverse organizations and groups, and how various combinations of these styles impact
            employees' attitudes, behaviors, and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also deeply interested in employee well-being, driven by my belief that organizations and managers
            should maximize employees’ interests to achieve high organizational performance. I genuinely care about
            working individuals' physical and psychological health, particularly how work-related stress and
            work/nonwork recovery practices influence employees' short- and long-term well-being. Recently, I have
            observed the growing popularity of activities like cycling and hiking in Shanghai, a fast-paced, high-
            demand city. Fully geared up and eagerly heading for hiking trips immediately after finishing work on Friday
            has become a trendy phenomenon on social media. As an avid participant, I once spent two days and one night
            hiking and noticed those desolate mountains were crowded with young people, even as late as 1-2 AM. This
            sparked my curiosity about the essence and impact of this activity. What drives these busy young people to
            spend so much time traveling to remote places for such pursuits? Whether and how do their stress levels,
            emotions, and energy fluctuate before, during, and after this activity? What are the positive effects of
            this activity on them in the short and long term? Whether and how these effects spill over to the work
            domain? Since the current focus on recovery tends to emphasize psychological experiences—psychological
            detachment, relaxation, mastery, and control— with far less attention paid to the activities themselves, I
            seek to further define and distinguish the essence of after-work activities and identify other mechanisms
            beyond current psychological experiences that foster the process of being recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another key area of interest for me includes identity and status—particularly how multiple identities and
            diverse statuses are formed, evolve, and influence individuals within and across groups. I am particularly
            intrigued by groups with complex and often conflicting experiences, such as individuals from remote,
            impoverished areas who ascend to high-status professions or those from affluent, highly educated backgrounds
            who find themselves in low autonomy or menial roles. I am interested in conducting a longitudinal study on
            these groups to trace the developmental trajectories of their identities and statuses, uncovering the
            antecedents, mechanisms, outcomes, and moderating factors that shape these processes, making a substantial
            contribution to theory and practice. I have initiated discussions with the leader and team at Gedar
            Highrise. This non-profit organization supports academically talented students from remote, disadvantaged
            regions through scholarships and career development programs. They have expressed strong interest in
            collaborating on this project, offering a promising opportunity to advance this research initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
            With these interests in mind, I am eager to work with the faculty at Stephen M. Ross School of Business, not
            only due to the alignment of research interests but also because of their exceptional scholarly character.
            Among them, Prof. Lindy Greer’s insightful research on power, status, hierarchy, and diversity, Prof. Justin
            Berg’s research on creativity and innovation, Prof. Aparna Joshi’s work on how individuals recognize,
            respond to, and relate to one another across differences, Prof. Ethan Kross’s studies on emotions and
            self-control, and Prof. Julia Lee Cunningham’s exploration of the psychology of narratives, mindsets, and
            behavioral ethics are areas where I would like to explore and contribute to.
        </p>
        <p>
            I strongly believe that the Stephen M. Ross School of Business is an ideal place for me to grow as a great
            scholar, mentor, and leader. The school’s commitment to preparing students for positions at top universities
            and generating research that addresses the most complex issues in business resonates deeply with my
            aspirations. At Ross, I aim to push beyond the feasible and pursue transformative work. With its exceptional
            resources, mentorship, and collaborative learning environment, I am confident that Ross will help provide a
            strong foundation to do so. Please let me know if there is any additional information I can provide. Thank
            you for your time and consideration!
